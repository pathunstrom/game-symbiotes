Beat monstrous warriors and creatures, collect their battle spirits and 
combine their best qualities into yourself. Become the perfect warrior: 
The Symbiote.

An idea that borrows from Shadows of the Colossus, Titan Souls, and Megaman.

Features:

* Symbiotes and equipment: Equip your warrior with symbiotic spirits and 
  conventional equipment to take down bigger and badder beasts.
* The Beasts: Each encounter is a specially designed beast with unique attack 
  patterns and skills. You'll need to master the combination of skills the 
  symbiotes provide.
* Shops: The symbiote is a terrifying creature, and depending on the spirits 
  you're most attuned to, certain citizens will keep you from their 
  businesses. Good luck getting rest when the inn stops letting you in.
